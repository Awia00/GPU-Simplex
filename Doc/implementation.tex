\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Test Instance Generation}
A simplex test instance consists of the coefficient vector, the constraints matrix and the constants vector. Each value is randomly generated as a float with value between 0 and 100. Afterwards the instance is solved by the off the shelf algorithm to ensure that the solution can be solved and to provide the expected output. 

The instance generator can be used to generate multiple instances of multiple sizes to allow testing how differing dimension lengths and number of instances can influence the running time of the different implementations.

\subsection{Parallel on Multiple Instances}
Parallel map outside

\subsection{Parallel Simplex on Single Instance}
nested parallelism in map map
Flattening on Matrix

\subsection{Parallel Simplex on Multiple Instances}
Nested parallelism on iotas, reduces, scans.
Flattening of across instances
Mention problem with asociative scans
