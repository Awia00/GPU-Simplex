\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Test Instance Generation}
To generate test instances which was solvable and 

\subsection{Parallel on Multiple Instances}
Parallel map outside

\subsection{Parallel Simplex on Single Instance}
nested parallelism in map map
Flattening on Matrix

\subsection{Parallel Simplex on Multiple Instances}
Nested parallelism on iotas, reduces, scans.
Flattening of across instances
Mention problem with asociative scans
