\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that it is possible to achieve significant speed-up of the simplex algorithm by utilizing modern easily available GPU hardware. Our implementations were in all cases faster than the off the shelf algorithm, and achieved an up to x\todo{x} factor speed-up. As expected different implementations had different strength and there are trade-offs which must be taken into account when trying to achieve a higher level of parallelism. This calls for implementations which dynamically can decide which model to use to obtain the best performance.

Our results show the importance of further work in the area of parallelism across multiple instances, since it is not necessarily possible to utilize full parallelism of modern hardware when chosen between parallelism of the individual instance or across instances.
