\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that it is possible to achieve significant speed-up of the simplex algorithm by utilizing modern easily available GPU hardware. Our implementations were in all cases faster than the off the shelf algorithm, and achieved an up to x\todo{x} factor speed-up.

Our results show the importance of further research in the area of parallelism on multi instance problems, since it is not necessarily possible to utilize full parallelism of modern hardware when chosen between parallelism of the individual instance or across instances.
