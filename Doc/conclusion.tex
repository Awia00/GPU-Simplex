\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that it is possible to achieve significant speed-up of the simplex algorithm by utilising modern GPU hardware. Our implementations were in all cases faster than the off-the-shelf algorithm\todo{most? update with new runs}, and achieved an up to x\todo{x} factor speed-up. As expected different implementations had different strength and there are trade-offs which must be taken into account when trying to achieve a better utilisation of the parallel hardware. This calls for implementations which dynamically can decide which model to use to obtain the best performance.

Our results show the importance of further work in the area of parallelism across multiple instances, since it is not necessarily possible to fully exploit parallelism when solving an individual instance.

We have shown that it is possible to achieve significant speed-up of the simplex algorithm by utilising modern GPU hardware. Our implementations were in most cases faster than the off-the-shelf algorithm, and achieved a speedup an up to 3 factor speed-up. As expected, different implementations had different strength and there are trade-offs which must be taken into account when trying to achieve a better utilisation of the parallel hardware. This calls for implementations which dynamically can decide which model to use to obtain the best performance.
