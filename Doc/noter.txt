Efficient Implementation of the Simplex Method on a CPU-GPU System - 2011:
260 gti -- 
One instance only.

Double precision implementation is used in order to improve the quality of solutions. 

Entering and leaving are faster on CPU than GPU. 

Calculates pivot blockwise.

Max size = 8000x8000

For large non-sparse linear programming problems, we have obtained stable speedups around 12.5 - when compared to a CPU implementation.
